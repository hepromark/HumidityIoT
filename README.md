# HumidityIoT
### Repository for ESP8266 Arduino Code as part of my Humidity IoT Project. 
Under each arduino folder (project) there will be a Secrets.h containing auth certificates needed for board to
connect with AWS IoT core. It is not commited into the repo for privacy reasons but they are required for 
code to execute.
